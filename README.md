# COVID-19_Estimation
Covid-19 Predictions Using a Novel Hybrid model of Log-Likelihood Maximized Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and minimization of residual error using Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) The data for our purpose shall be obtained from multiple sources such as, COVID19-India API and John Hopkins University.

The model has the aim of implementing the following,
<li>Build an ML model for predicting the number of total infections in India till 31st of July 2020.</li>
<li>Build an ML model for predicting the number of deaths in India till 31st of July 2020.</li>
<li>Build an ML model and predict recovery rate and death rate in India for the period 15th June to 31st of July.</li>
